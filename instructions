For this assignment you are to implement a simple calculator as a web application. 
Your calculator should behave as close as possible to the google calculator. 
You may style the calculator as you like

Your calculator should support the following features:

	all numbers (0-9) as well as the decimal point (.)
	equal sign - displaying the expression and the result, or error if expression is invalid
	basic arithmetic operators (+, -, * and /)
	the backspace button (CE)
	left and right brackets
	re-using the previously computed value in the next calculation

Your calculator should work in desktop mode and in mobile mode:

	on desktop the calculator should be 600 pixels wide, and centered horizontally;
	on mobile devices the calculator should be horizontally stretched across the whole screen.

You are allowed to use the following technologies in your implementation:

	plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	SCSS, LESS, Bootstrap, JQuery, JQuery UI

your calculator should not contain any server-side scripts
if you plan to use any other technology, please ask your instructor for permission first.
Your assignment must be publicly viewable. That means you must host it on a publicly available web server. 
We discussed some free hosting choices in the class.

Make sure your calculator works in Google Chrome (both in desktop mode and in Device Mode ).

You do not need to handle keyboard events, only mouse clicks on the buttons.
